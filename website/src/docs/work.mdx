## Lookup by Faust

One may look up a work by providing a faust.

<InlineGraphiQL
  query={`query ($faust: String!) {
      work(faust: $faust) {
        id
        title
      }
    }`}
  variables={{
    faust: "48953786",
  }}
/>

It is possible to look up multiple works by providing a list of fausts.
The order of fausts are preserved when returning the list of works.
If no work is found for a faust, null is returned at the corresponding position.

<InlineGraphiQL
  query={`query ($faust: [String!]!) {
      works(faust: $faust) {
        id
        title
      }
    }`}
  variables={{
    faust: ["48953786", "61965815", "unknown-faust"],
  }}
/>

## Reviews

The reviews field returns a list of `Review`. Review is a union type consisting
of the following underlying concrete types:

- `ReviewInfomedia` includes infomediaId and pid that can be used to look up the actual
  article. Check out the examples for infomedia.
- `ReviewExternalMedia` includes an url to an external website where the review is located.
- `ReviewMatVurd` is the librarians review. The entire review can be obtained from this object type.

<InlineGraphiQL
  query={`query ($id: String!) {
  work(id: $id) {
    id
    title
    reviews {
      __typename
      ... on ReviewInfomedia {
        author
        media
        reference {
          infomediaId
          pid
        }
      }
      ... on ReviewExternalMedia {
        author
        media
        url
        
      }
      ... on ReviewMatVurd {
        author
        date
        all {
          name
          text
        }
      }
    }
  }
}`}
  variables={{
    id: "work-of:870970-basis:51701763",
  }}
/>

## Articles

The full content of an article may be accessible with Infomedia.
This example shows how to get the infomedia reference. Use the pid to get hold of
the full article. See the Infomedia example.

<InlineGraphiQL
  query={`query ($id: String!) {
  work(id: $id) {
    id
    title
    manifestations {
      onlineAccess {
        __typename
        ... on InfomediaReference {
          pid
        }
      }
    }
  }
}`}
  variables={{
    id: "work-of:870971-avis:33301561",
  }}
/>
