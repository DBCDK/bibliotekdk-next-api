## Lookup by Faust

One may look up a work by providing a faust.

<InlineGraphiQL
  query={`query ($faust: String!) {
      work(faust: $faust) {
        id
        title
      }
    }`}
  variables={{
    faust: "48953786",
  }}
/>

It is possible to look up multiple works by providing a list of fausts.
The order of fausts are preserved when returning the list of works.
If no work is found for a faust, null is returned at the corresponding position.

<InlineGraphiQL
  query={`query ($faust: [String!]!) {
      works(faust: $faust) {
        id
        title
      }
    }`}
  variables={{
    faust: ["48953786", "61965815", "unknown-faust"],
  }}
/>
